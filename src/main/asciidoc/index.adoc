Bus routes is a micro service with REST-API supporting a single URL and only GET requests.

=== Check direct route
`GET` endpoint for checking if two stations are connected.

Examples:

Using cURL:

include::{snippets}/direct/curl-request.adoc[]

HTTP request:

include::{snippets}/direct/http-request.adoc[]

HTTP response:

include::{snippets}/direct/http-response.adoc[]

== HTTP status codes
Bus routes service tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| Standard response for successful HTTP requests.


| `400 Bad Request`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.
